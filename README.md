# NASA-Land-Forcings

As part of a large research project using environmental data, I downloaded 15 years of data from NASA.  This is how I did it, after registering with NASA and submitting my request.

The most useful code bits here include:
* using a hash as an index for the files, 
* creating a pandas dataframe and auto-populating the columns from a text file and a python list, and
* performing get requests with error handling.
